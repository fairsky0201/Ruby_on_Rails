# Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails, often simply called Rails, is a popular and powerful web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a robust and elegant solution for building dynamic, database-driven websites and applications.

Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, which means it provides sensible defaults and conventions that help developers focus on writing application-specific code rather than spending time on repetitive configuration tasks. This approach leads to increased productivity and faster development cycles.

Key Features of Ruby on Rails:
- Full-stack framework: Rails covers both the backend and frontend aspects of web development, making it a comprehensive solution.
- ActiveRecord: Rails' ActiveRecord ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplifies database interactions by mapping database tables to Ruby objects.
- RESTful Routing: Rails follows RESTful principles for defining routes, making it easy to create clean and intuitive APIs.
- Convention over Configuration: Rails minimizes the need for explicit configuration by relying on sensible conventions, reducing code verbosity.
- Gems and Plugins: The Rails ecosystem offers a wide range of gems and plugins that extend functionality and enable rapid development.

Ruby on Rails has a strong and supportive community, with a wealth of resources, documentation, and community-driven libraries available. It has been widely adopted by startups, enterprises, and individual developers for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
